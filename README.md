# Amateur Radio Data Service Tools

PostgreSQL data store for Amateur Radio Data. Includes ADIF Spec Enumeration,
FCC ULS, LoTW, eSQL, and More. Manage by CLI, WebMVC, and Swagger OpenAPI.  

The ARDS project is a culmination of several frameworks and languages: 
PostgreSQL, Python, C#, shell scripts, and more. While pulling the elements
together, the SQL scripts will function as intended, however, the parent
management tool may not.

## Under Construction

This repository is under development, and is not in a stable installation state.

## Documentation

Project documentation will be hosted on `Github.io` when available.
