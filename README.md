# Radio Data Service

PostgreSQL data store for Amateur Radio Data. Includes ADIF Spec Enumeration, LoTW, eSQL,
and More. Manage by CLI, WebMVC, and Swagger OpenAPI.  

The RDS project is a culmination of several frameworks and languages: PostgreSQL, Python, C#,
shell scripts, and more. While pulling the elements together, the SQL scripts will function as
intended, however, the parent managment tool may not.
